:round_pushpin:- Steps 

    - The Shell is an infinite Loop that keeps running until exit or reaching end of file (EOF).
    During its lifetime, the shell does three main things : 
    -Initialize: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. 
    These change aspects of the shellâ€™s behavior.
    -Interpret: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file)
    and executes them.
    -Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands,
    frees up any memory, and terminates.
